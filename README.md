# WIS2 monitoring and metric hierarchy

## Overview

This repository defines the metrics to be exposed by Global Services (see: metrics), precomputed metrics (see: rules) and alert rules for the Global Monitor (see: alerts)

The WIS2 Global Monitoring fetches metrics from all WIS2 Global Services, precomputes the defined metrics and generates alerts based on the defined alerting rules.

## Governance 

Updates to WIS2 Metrics are submitted as Pull Requests, requesting approval from Reviewers. Changes should be discussed in ET-W2IT before approval. Implementation of changes is coordinated on a case-by-case basis as needed among the WIS2 Global Services and other supporting services such as Sensor Centres.

Given that WIS2 Metrics are only implemented by Global Services and supporting services, there is no need for review by INFCOM Members using the FAST-TRACK approval process. Most Members are unaffected by any change.

Metrics are not published to the WMO Codes Registry.
